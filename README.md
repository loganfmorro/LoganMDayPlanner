# My Day Planner
This is an application design to allow the user to input a to-do activity during their work day, and save it to localstorage so that even when they refresh the page the activity remains in the assigned hour block. If the user does not save their input, the activity will not be saved. I've added a shadowbox that pulses if the user has input data without saving.

The blocks will highlight in a violet for the current time and green for any upcoming time blocks. Any blocks prior to the current time will be highlighted in grey. 

The date will change at the top to relate to the current day so that users know which day they are planning for

Overall this project was pretty challenging, but very fun to create. I found that my classmates were very resourceful and helpful during this homework assignment!
